# Project-Projects
> An Olin project database that makes life a little easier.

Olin students can record their projects in *Project: Projects* to keep track of all the cool stuff they've done, easily build their portfolios, and share their experiences. This is a project started by Matthew Beaudouin-Lafon (Olin College '19) and Emily Yeh (also Olin College '19).
