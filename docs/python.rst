Python Backend Things
=====================

Here, you will find documentation of all Python functions. All Python files are found in the main folder. There are three files: backend.py, database_functions.py, and (temporarily) private_database_functions.py, which depends on the inclusion of some private .csv files. Email or message either Matthew or Emily to get access to these files.
